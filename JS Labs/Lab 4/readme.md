The purpose of this lab is to practice programming JavaScript events using the Document Object Model.
The theme of this lab is that we'll be creating a registration page where the user can register her/himself by clicking the Register button.

Registration Form filed
Name: This is a text box where the user can fill Username.

Password: This is a password filed where the user can fill a password. While he is filling a password, he can see the strength of the password next to the Password field like weak, good, or strong.

Show eye icon: Password field has the "Show eye icon" button. User can Show/ Hide password after clicking in this button.

Confirm Password: This is a text box, in this field user will fill the same password for confirmation. If the password will not match, the alert message "Password did not match" should appear next to the "Confirm Password" field.

Sex: This is a dropdown box where the user can select his/her sex. When user select male or female then male or female symbol should appear next to the sex field.

Register: This is a button, after clicking in this button, the form should disappear, and the "Registration successful" message should appear in next page. Before moving a successful page, it should validate all the fields. If any field is empty, then alert message should show "Field can't be empty".
