## Java Script

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images and much more on web pages. It is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn along with HTML and CSS. JavaScript is lightweight, interpreted or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.

## Events

In JavaScript, events are actions that occur when a user interacts with a webpage or when the browser manipulates a page. These events can be hooked to elements in the Document Object Model (DOM). For example, when a page loads or when a user clicks a button, these are both considered events.

There are many common JavaScript events that can be implemented. Some examples include 

* `onclick`
* `onkeyup`
* `onkeydown`
* `onmouseover`
* `onmouseout`
* `onchange`
* `onblur`
* `onload`
* `onfocus`
* `onsubmit`
* `ondblclick`
* `onkeypress`
* `onselect`
* `onscroll`
* `onresize` 
* ` oninput`
