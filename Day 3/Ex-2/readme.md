## Rest Operator

The rest operator is used to create a function that accepts a variable number of arguments in JavaScript. It is denoted by three dots (...) as a prefix followed by the name of the parameter. The rest operator allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. With the help of a rest parameter, a function can be called with any number of arguments, no matter how it was defined.
