## Spread Operator

The spread operator helps iterable objects expand into individual elements. Iterable objects are those on which we can use a loop, for example, Array, Map, Set, etc. In other words, the spread operator allows us to copy all elements from an existing array or object into another array or object. It is mostly used in variable arrays where more than one value is expected.

Some other uses of spread operator include:

- Expanding an iterable such as an array expression or string in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected.
- Copying items into a single array using spread syntax.
- Cloning an array using spread operator.
- It is often used in combination with destructuring.
