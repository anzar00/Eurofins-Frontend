## Promise 

---

A promise is a special JavaScript object that links the “producing code” and the “consuming code” together. It represents processes that are already happening, which can be chained with callback functions. A Promise object can be in one of three states: Pending, Fulfilled or Rejected. The methods `Promise.prototype.then()`, `Promise.prototype.catch()`, and `Promise.prototype.finally()` are used to associate further action with a promise that becomes settled. As these methods return promises, they can be chained.
